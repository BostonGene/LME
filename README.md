### Navigation


1. Pan-DLBCL cohort LME types and signature scores could be found in datasets/ folder
1. Signatures in GMT format are deposited in databases/signatures.gmt (please note that for clustering only 22 were used + 3 progeny pathways)
1. Notebook with classification <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BostonGene/LME/blob/master/classification.ipynb">Classification.ipynb</a>
1. Classification script: classification.py

_.ipynb files could by opened at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ or downloaded as HTML files from upstream_html folder_
